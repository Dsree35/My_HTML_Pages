    <p> The <a href="https://www.pup.edu.ph/about/history" target="blank"> History of PUP </a> may well parallel the nation's growth and development. <br> 
        As it met the needs of a fledgling Philippine civil service under American rule forged from anvil of Spanish colonialism, <br>
        so will it serve the rising expectations of the people in the 21st century...desirous now of reclaiming their rightful place <br>
        in the community of independent nations. As it has withstood the test of time, so will it continue to pace contemporary Philippine history.<br>
